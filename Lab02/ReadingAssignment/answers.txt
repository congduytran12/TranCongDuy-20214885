* When should accessor methods be used?
	Accessor method is used to return the value of an instance (or static) variable to the user. Since the method is returning a value to the user, the method header should contain the return type in place of the keyword void.

* If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
